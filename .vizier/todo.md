Deprecation (2025-11-17): This file no longer carries active TODOs.

Vizier now tracks work as thread-specific artifacts under `.vizier/todo_*.md`, each tied to a Snapshot thread with its own acceptance criteria and cross-links. This `todo.md` file remains only as a shim for backlinks and historical references; new work should land in dedicated per-thread TODO files.

If you find an active task here, migrate it into the appropriate thread-specific TODO and keep this file free of live items to avoid duplicate backlogs.
