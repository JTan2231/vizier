Update (author note: persistent config)
- Clarify persistence scope: Profiles are stored under .vizier/profiles/<name>.toml; a project-local default profile is .vizier/profile.toml when no name is provided. This reflects current direction for durable, human-editable config.
- Add acceptance: If no explicit profile is provided, `--save-profile` writes to .vizier/profile.toml and subsequent runs without flags pick up the saved thinking_level.
- Add acceptance: Loading order is (highest to lowest) CLI > session override > named profile > project default profile > baked-in defaults. The effective source tag reflects which tier won.
- Non-destructive guarantee: When persisting, unrelated config keys in the existing profile are preserved; only updated keys change. Atomic write remains required.

Update (2025-10-04): Clarify scope and persistence model.

Behavior:
- Expose thinking_level as a config key (vizier.toml) and CLI override flag (e.g., --thinking-level=<brief|standard|verbose>). Applies to assistant/tool prompts and governs verbosity of intermediate status events.
- Persistence: Stored in repo-local config by default; can be overridden per-invocation; assistant should echo active value in header/meta.

Acceptance:
- Running with different levels yields observable differences in status verbosity and, where applicable, prompt scaffolding (not output contracts).
- Config precedence: CLI flag > repo config > default.
- Session log records active thinking_level.

Cross-links: Control levers thread; stdout/stderr contract (only affects status density, not Outcome).
