Running Snapshot — updated

Narrative theme
- Reduce operator friction: conversational intent is authorization to evolve the project. The assistant maintains a living snapshot and task list by default; users can explicitly opt out per turn.
- Editorial housekeeping: Canonicalize duplicated TODO artifacts so each thread has a single authoritative TODO with cross-links; avoid parallel/duplicated tracks. Add aggressive TODO garbage-collection during save to keep the garden clean.

Active threads
- Agent Basic Command (Workflow B MVP): ACTIVE. Product stance locked: pick a TODO → apply agent changes on an isolated branch with a templated prompt (references the TODO + current Snapshot) → optionally open a PR → await human review → finalize via `vizier save` on merge. Safety: main remains untouched until merge; abort is clean. Outcome must report {todo, branch, commit_count, pr_url?/review_instructions, gate_state}. [Depends on: VCS/Auditor/Chat/Config]
- Terminal-first minimal TUI + renderer-neutral events: ACTIVE, UPDATED. Avoid fullscreen/alt-screen; default to line-oriented output that plays well with shells/tmux/SSH and piping. Core will expose a renderer-neutral event stream (message/tool/status/outcome) consumable by CLI now and future surfaces later. Outcome delivery remains CLI-first until a UI surface exists. Canonical TODO consolidated. [Depends on: Code State]
- Stdout/stderr contract + verbosity: ACTIVE, ADVANCED. Acceptance tightened: TTY-gated progress on stderr only; never emit ANSI to stdout; -q/-v/-vv mapped to config; stable final Outcome on stdout (human by default; JSON when --json or protocol mode). Integration test matrix defined across {TTY, non-TTY} × {quiet, default, -v, -vv} × {--json}. [Cross: Outcome summaries, Mode split]
- Mode split: Chat (default) vs Protocol Mode v1: ACTIVE, ADVANCED. Dedicated TODO added with event.v1 + outcome.v1 alignment, deterministic NDJSON on stdout, exit code categories, and non-interactive guarantees. `--mode protocol` toggles behavior. [Cross: Stdout/stderr contract, Outcome summaries]
- Commit isolation + gates: ACTIVE. Conversation- and agent-sourced changes are staged behind a Pending Commit gate. Per-hunk accept/reject remains open. [Depends on: Code State]
- Default-Action Posture (DAP): ACTIVE. By default, snapshot and TODOs update on any directive unless user opts out (e.g., “discuss-only”). CLI will surface a one-line Outcome when DAP acts. [Cross: Outcome summaries, Integration tests]
- Outcome summaries: ACTIVE, ADVANCED. outcome.v1 schema specified and CLI epilogue mapping defined. Chat path must emit Auditor-backed A/M/D/R counts; assistant final mirrors the same facts. JSON and human epilogues aligned; suppression via --quiet. [Depends on: Auditor]
- Control levers surface: ACTIVE. Config levers (history_limit, confirm_destructive, auto_commit, non_interactive, model params, system_prompt_override, thinking_level). Thinking level requested; schema in progress; echoed in meta/header. [Cross: CLI flags]
- Agent Decision Log + AGENTS.md interop: ACTIVE. Establish AGENTS.md v1 scaffold with Contract, Interop Guide, and Decision Log. After agent-driven operations, append a concise Decision entry referencing TODO/thread IDs and Outcome facts. CLI affords `vizier agents show|append`. Canonical TODO consolidated. [Depends on: Outcome summaries, Session logging, Invariants, Agent Basic Command]
- Operation history + revert: PLANNED. Persistent history with revert(n). Planned after session logging.
- Session logging to filesystem: PLANNED, BLOCKED BY WIRING. Chat sessions are not yet persisted; add a session writer at chat boundaries to save audited facts + workflow metadata. [Depends on: Auditor facts, Outcome]
- Native chat + navigation: ACTIVE, NARROWED. Define minimal navigation affordances for chat history, focusing on scrolling/paging for long conversations and large tool outputs, respecting terminal-minimal constraints.
- Config-driven prompt customization: ONGOING. Swap system prompts via files/CLI; reflect active path in meta/header.
- Snapshot bootstrap for existing repos: PLANNED. `vizier snapshot init` generates initial .vizier/.snapshot and seed TODOs safely/idempotently; include Threads section with stable IDs and cross-links. [Idempotent; diff-like updates]
- Narrative timelines: PLANNED. Persistent threads with IDs; TODOs cross-link to threads and snapshot moments.
- Integration tests: ONGOING. Guard commit isolation, DAP behavior, config→CLI mapping, and (as they land) history/revert, outcome summaries, mode split, and terminal-minimal/output contracts.
- SSH push reliability: ACTIVE. Policy: no ssh-agent dependency. Ensure `vizier save --push` works with default file-based SSH keys and provides clear, non-interactive guidance on failures; HTTPS path unchanged. [Depends on: VCS push_current_branch, CLI error surface]
- TODO Garbage-Collection on save: ACTIVE. Vizier aggressively removes duplicate, superseded, empty, and orphaned TODOs during `vizier save` and after material TODO merges, with safety levers and clear Outcome reporting. [Depends on: Config, Auditor, VCS, file tracking, Snapshot Threads]

Code state (behaviors that matter)
- CLI emits transient spinner/status to stderr via vizier-core::display with ANSI cursor controls unconditionally, causing leaked sequences like "[1G\u001b[2K⡋ Thinking..." in logs and non-TTY contexts.
- stdout is inconsistently used; many operations primarily talk via stderr (status) and have no stable stdout outcome line.
- No verbosity controls beyond a debug flag; no quiet mode; no progress/ANSI gating by TTY.
- No explicit mode switch exists; protocol-style behavior is not yet implemented. JSON stream/eventing is planned; TODO created to ground Protocol Mode v1 behavior and exit codes.
- No vizier-tui crate present; CLI + vizier-core surfaces (display/chat) are the user-facing paths in this repo.
- Chat path now routes through the Auditor; diffs from chat-initiated changes can be reported with A/M/D/R. Session JSON logging is not wired yet.
- Post-action UX lacks a unified Outcome section; assistant epilogues can be verbose/misaligned, but Auditor facts for chat are available to drive a canonical epilogue. outcome.v1 schema is now specified; wiring pending.
- Renderer stance: Terminal-minimal mode and renderer-neutral event stream are planned additions; Protocol Mode TODO defines event.v1 skeleton.
- Agent Basic Command: Not implemented yet; design anchored on Workflow B (branch/PR + vizier save) with defined Outcome fields.
- AGENTS.md contract/log: File exists; v1 scaffold defined at product level; CLI interop pending.
- VCS push uses libgit2 with credentials callback; policy is to not depend on ssh-agent and to attempt default file-based key paths for SSH. Error messages are currently generic.
- Chat navigation and scrolling: Not implemented; long outputs overflow terminal buffer with no native paging. Users rely on terminal scrollback only; no in-app paging indicators or key handling.
- TODO GC not yet implemented; policy and levers defined; to be wired into save path and Auditor Outcome.

Acceptance checkpoints (selected)
- Stdout/stderr contract: Non-TTY emits no ANSI; stdout carries final results; stderr limited to errors/warnings unless verbose. Flags -q/-v/-vv implemented; TTY-gated progress. JSON modes obey schema outcome.v1. Test matrix asserts stream discipline. [Active]
- Mode split: `--mode protocol` produces only structured JSON/NDJSON on stdout (no human prose), no ANSI in any environment, deterministic event ordering, categorized exit codes, and non-interactive by default. JSON stream aligns with renderer-neutral events and ends with outcome.v1. [Active]
- Pending Commit gate guards conversation changes with confirm_destructive=true and auto_commit=false.
- Conversation commits only touch .vizier; preserve pre-existing staged changes exactly (A/M/D/R).
- Non-interactive CLI requires explicit consent; never opens editor.
- Config-driven prompt path visible in meta/header; thinking_level echoed.
- Session JSON MVP: session.json written atomically at session end, validating schema; includes workflow_type and thinking_level. [Pending; not yet saving]
- Outcome summaries: After each operation, users see a compact summary matching Auditor/VCS facts; assistant final mirrors it. outcome.v1 field set defined; human epilogue mapping specified. [CLI-first]
- Terminal-minimal output: default avoids alt-screen/full redraws; in non-TTY contexts there are no ANSI control sequences. [Planned]
- Renderer-neutral event stream: versioned lifecycle events (message/tool/status/outcome) consumable by CLI and future renderers; `--json-stream` exposed. [Planned]
- Chat scrolling/paging: In TTY, support PageUp/PageDown, Home/End, and line-wise Up/Down; show a status line with position (e.g., 42/120) and a visible selection. Large tool outputs are collapsible with one-line summaries. Non-TTY never emits ANSI; pagination degrades to plain prompts or line-limited output. Works under tmux and resizes. [Active]
- Agent Basic Command (Workflow B): `vizier agent run <todo>` creates an isolated branch from baseline, applies agent-authored commits, and leaves main unchanged; Outcome reports TODO, branch name, commit count, PR URL if any; `vizier save` after merge updates TODO and Snapshot, links PR/merge; honors gates and preserves staged changes; session log captures workflow metadata. [Planned]
- AGENTS.md v1: Repo includes AGENTS.md with Contract, Interop Guide, and Decision Log sections. After each agent-driven operation, a single Decision Log entry is appended, referencing TODO/thread IDs and Outcome facts. CLI exposes `vizier agents show|append`. Outcome epilogue notes if AGENTS.md updated. [Planned]
- SSH push reliability: `vizier save --push` succeeds with default SSH keys (~/.ssh/id_ed25519, ~/.ssh/id_rsa) when usable non-interactively; on failure, error surfaces scheme, strategies attempted, and guidance; never prompts interactively. [Active]
- TODO GC on save: During `vizier save`, duplicate/superseded/empty/orphaned TODOs are deleted or staged for deletion per config; Outcome reports deletions with reasons; dry-run supported; protected items skipped. [Active]

14) SSH push reliability: drop ssh-agent dependency; expand credentials strategies to include default file-based keys; enrich error reporting; add unit-level smoke for strategy ordering; document manual verification. [Active]

Cross-links
- Terminal-minimal ↔ Chat navigation: scrolling must not violate minimal rendering; event stream can drive future TUI without alt-screen.
- Output contract/verbosity ↔ Control levers: flags map cleanly to config and display behavior.
- Mode split ↔ Stdout/stderr contract ↔ Event stream: protocol guarantees flow from the same invariants; CLI flags and JSON stream remain coherent.
- Agent Basic Command ↔ Auditor/Outcome summaries: safety + factual epilogue across CLI.
- AGENTS.md interop ↔ Invariants/Session logging: persist decisions and point to active invariants; session logs record AGENTS.md updates.
- Snapshot bootstrap ↔ Narrative timelines: generated Threads with stable IDs; TODOs and snapshot cross-reference.
- SSH push reliability ↔ VCS + CLI: core handles auth strategies; CLI surfaces actionable guidance non-interactively; policy clarified: no ssh-agent dependency.
- TODO GC ↔ Editorial housekeeping + DAP + Outcome: keep TODOs canonical and lean; report actions clearly; respect gates and protections.
