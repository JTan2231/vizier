Running Snapshot — updated

Narrative theme
- Operators should not have to micromanage the assistant to take actions. Prompts imply authorization to evolve the project narrative: convert conversational intent into concrete TODOs and keep the SNAPSHOT current by default. Opt-out should be explicit; opt-in should not be required.

Active threads
- Commit isolation + gates: Conversation commits isolated and pause at a Pending Commit gate. CLI UX partly landed; per-hunk accept/reject planned. [Depends on: Code State]
- Control levers surface: Config levers (history_limit, confirm_destructive, auto_commit, non_interactive, model params, system_prompt_override, thinking level). Thinking level requested; schema in progress.
- Operation history + revert: Not built yet; planned.
- Native Chat + Diff/editor basics: Split-view concepts exist in core chat/display surfaces, but no separate TUI crate in this repo. Long multiline messages + scrolling behavior are handled by core render paths used in tests. [Related to modes thread]
- Integration tests: Guard commit isolation, config→CLI mapping, and (as they land) history/revert.
- Issue tracking bridge: Use GitHub Issues for task-specific items; keep narratives/gates inside Vizier.
- Chat navigation modes: View vs Edit to prevent accidental edits; input handling pending. [Deferred until UI surface exists]
- Config-driven prompt customization: Swap system prompts via files/CLI; reflect active path in meta/header.
- Snapshot bootstrap for existing repos: Generate initial .vizier/.snapshot + seed TODOs; safe/idempotent.
- Narrative timelines: Persistent “threads” with IDs; TODOs cross-link to threads.
- Session logging to filesystem: Persist each assistant session as structured JSON; basis for resume.
- Outcome summaries across interfaces: Standardize "What happened" summaries after any operation (CLI epilogue now prioritized). Assistant final turn must be concise, action-labeled, and aligned with actual changes. [Depends on: Auditor]
- Default-Action Posture (DAP): ACTIVE. By default, the assistant converts conversational intent into TODOs and updates the SNAPSHOT without being told to “take an action.” Users can prepend “no-op”/“discuss-only” to disable. UI indicators are CLI-first; TUI indicators deferred until a UI surface lands.

Code state (behaviors that matter)
- No separate vizier-tui crate in this repo. Chat/render surfaces live under vizier-core (display/chat) and are exercised by CLI/tests.
- Auditor exists and supports staged-set isolation with VCS helpers (A/M/D/R). CLI `ask` path participates in the Pending Commit gate when auto_commit=false.
- Some Chat behaviors (rendering long messages, scrolling) are present in core display paths; explicit input modes not implemented.
- Session JSON logging MVP is planned; not yet wired.
- Post-action UX: No consistent, factual "Outcome" section; assistant final message can be verbose and not tightly mapped to audited changes.
- Assistant execution policy: Now DAP by default; explicit "no-op"/"discuss-only" suppresses changes in this turn.

Acceptance checkpoints (selected)
- Pending Commit gate with confirm_destructive=true and auto_commit=false.
- Conversation commits only touch .vizier; preserve pre-existing staged changes exactly (A/M/D/R).
- Non-interactive CLI requires explicit consent; never opens editor.
- Config-driven prompt selection visible in meta and header.
- Session JSON: On session end, session.json is written and validates MVP schema; write-once with atomic rename. [Pending]
- Outcome summaries: After each operation, users see a compact factual summary matching Auditor/VCS facts. Assistant final mirrors it.
- DAP: By default, assistant updates .snapshot and TODOs when user gives any directive that implies change; suppressed when user message clearly opts out. CLI affordances show when DAP is active, with a one-line Outcome noting created/updated items.

Next moves (minimal sequence)
1) Finalize config schema; expose to prompt/meta (system_prompt path, thinking_level). [Ongoing]
2) Add CLI flags (--system-prompt-override, --thinking-level, --profile). [Ongoing]
3) Commit gate UX across CLI/headless. [Ongoing]
4) History skeleton with revert(n=1). [Planned]
5) Session logging JSON MVP. [Planned]
6) Extend tests for flags, persistence, commit gate, headless smoke, session write/read. [Planned]
7) Chat modes with key help and remapping. [Deferred until UI surface exists]
8) Outcome summaries component + assistant epilogue (CLI-first). [Ongoing]
9) Config TUI panel. [Deferred]
10) Narrative timelines with thread IDs. [Planned]
11) DAP: Policy enforced; surface in CLI; add tests. [Active]

Cross-links
- DAP ties to Outcome summaries (needs visible confirmation), Integration tests (behavioral guarantees), and Narrative timelines (threads must be auto-linked without explicit user commands).
- Absence of vizier-tui crate constrains near-term UI work to CLI and core display surfaces; related TODOs are scoped accordingly.
