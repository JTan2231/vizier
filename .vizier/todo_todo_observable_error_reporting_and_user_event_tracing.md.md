Context:
- Users lack visibility into errors and what actions the app is taking. Current TUI has ad-hoc status spinner (tui/src/lib.rs display_status) and drops detailed causes; chat TUI swallows errors in async task and prints only via println! on exit; file list TUI loses context when shelling to editor.

Deliverables (tight, code-anchored):

1) Replace opaque error swallow in chat.rs send_message join path with surfaced Assistant error frame
- File: tui/src/chat.rs
- Change: When wire::prompt_with_tools_and_status returns Err, capture error string and push a wire::types::Message { message_type: Assistant, content: format!("Error: {e}\nSee logs for details"), input/output_tokens=0 } into app.messages instead of unwrap().
- Also set receiving_handle back to None to stop spinner.
- Rationale: Today we .unwrap() in the spawned task, which panic-aborts the join. Showing a concrete Assistant message keeps the narrative visible in-session.

2) Stream structured progress/events into chat window via rx with prefixes and levels
- File: tui/src/chat.rs
- Change: Treat tx/rx channel as a structured status bus. Define message prefixes: "info:", "warn:", "error:", "tool:". In run_chat loop, on rx.try_recv(), map prefix to Color (info=White, warn=Yellow, error=Red, tool=Cyan) and render as Assistant messages with styled first token (retain existing message log type).
- Additionally, increment a per-level counter in Chat for quick summary in chat title (e.g., W:x E:y) alongside token counts.

3) Add an on-screen error panel in list_tui for actionable failures
- File: tui/src/lib.rs
- Change: Extend App with Vec<String> errors and last_action: String. Wrap fallible operations (fs::read_dir, read_to_string, enter_directory editor spawn) and push concise errors (including path) into errors.
- UI: In ui(), split vertical layout into [files | preview] and add a bottom row Constraint::Length(3) with a Paragraph titled "Events" that shows the last 3 entries of App.errors joined by newlines, color-coded red for lines starting with "Error:" and yellow for "Warn:".
- Behavior: When opening editor, if command fails, capture stderr/exit and append Error with editor and path; do not std::process::exit(0) â€” instead return to TUI and refresh.

4) Unify spinner/status with cancellable task scopes and cleanup
- File: tui/src/lib.rs display_status and call_with_status
- Change: Introduce Status::Info(String), Status::Warn(String) variants and colorize accordingly. Ensure display_status clears the spinner line on Done by printing "\r  \r" then a final "Done" or last message without spinner. Remove comment about messy carriage returns by implementing proper line clearing using crossterm::terminal::Clear(ClearType::CurrentLine).
- In call_with_status, propagate original API model and token counts instead of dummy GPT5 by requiring the closure to return a full Message or an error; on Err, also send Status::Error and return a synthetic Assistant message with content prefixed "Error:" only if caller requests; otherwise bubble error up to caller.

5) Add verbose logging toggle with VIZIER_DEBUG env var
- Files: tui/src/chat.rs and tui/src/lib.rs
- Change: Read std::env::var("VIZIER_DEBUG").is_ok(). If true, append a hidden System message at session start: "[debug enabled]" and also write errors to stderr with timestamps. In chat.rs title bar, append "DBG" when enabled.

6) Wire tool-level telemetry from prompts crate into TUI status bus
- Files: prompts/src/tools.rs and prompts/src/lib.rs
- Change: For each tool invocation, send progress over provided Sender<String> with structured prefixes (tool:start <name>, tool:output <summary>, tool:done <name>, warn:<msg>, error:<msg>). Ensure chat.rs passes tx into prompt_with_tools_and_status and that tools use it consistently.

7) Regression harness: panic-safety and UI resilience
- File: tui/src/chat.rs tests (new) and tui/src/lib.rs tests (new)
- Add async tests ensuring: a) spawned task error does not crash TUI; b) rx message with "error:" prefix renders into messages; c) display_status clears spinner. Use a mock wire::prompt_with_tools_and_status that returns Err and one that streams messages then Ok.

Notes:
- Keep narrative continuity: errors and events appear inline where users already look (chat log and bottom Events pane).
- Avoid generic "investigate" tasks; implement concrete rendering and propagation points.
