[2025-09-28] Cross-link to Narrative timelines thread (snapshot Threads). Acceptance: integration tests should assert that new TODOs created during runs include a thread reference (ID) and that the snapshot Threads section lists them under the correct thread. Pointers: tests/src/main.rs (parsing .vizier/.snapshot and TODO bodies).

Update (author note: persistent config)
- Extend tests to cover profile persistence and precedence, including:
  • Running with --thinking-level without save does not mutate profiles.
  • --save-profile writes to .vizier/profile.toml (or profiles/<name>.toml) and is picked up on next run.
  • Precedence resolution when both a named profile and project default exist.
  • Non-interactive mode honors CLI override and does not prompt to save.
- Pointers: tests/src/main.rs; vizier-core/src/config.rs; vizier-cli/src/main.rs

Update (2025-10-02): Add cases for DAP-active flows: (1) Any directive updates .snapshot and/or TODOs unless "discuss-only" present. (2) Epilogue Outcome line present and reflects created/updated items. (3) Conversation commits only touch .vizier; staged A/M/D/R from user are preserved byte-for-byte.
