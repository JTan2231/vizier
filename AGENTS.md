Please observe `.vizier/.snapshot`, the README.md, and the various prompts in lib.rs before planning so you can get a strong feel for what this project is about.
Please also take a careful look around the implementation to understand the architectural and styling patterns before implementating

See `docs/` for system documentation; `docs/prompt-config-matrix.md` is the canonical reference for prompt scopes, kinds, and config levers.

Please do not edit this file unless you are a human being.

Operational note: use `vizier plan` (or `vizier plan --json`) to print the fully resolved configuration — repo + global + CLI overrides, per-scope backend selection, and the resolved agent runtime — before kicking off draft/approve/review/merge. The command is read-only and does not start an Auditor session.
