`.vizier/narrative` contains your guiding light. Do not update unless explicitly instructed to do so.
Code changes mean `./cicd.sh` validation.
Code changes mean test updates.
Code changes mean docs updates.

See `docs/` for system documentation; `docs/prompt-config-matrix.md` is the canonical reference for prompt scopes, kinds, and config levers.
See `docs/config-reference.md` for the full configuration catalogue (agents/prompts/workflow/gates/display) plus override examples; `vizier plan` echoes the resolved settings.
Help output now routes through a TTY-aware pager (`--pager`/`--no-pager`, `$VIZIER_PAGER`) and honors `--no-ansi`/quiet; non-TTY always prints directly.

Please do not edit this file or the README unless you are a human being.
