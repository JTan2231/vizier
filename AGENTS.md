Please observe `.vizier/narrative/snapshot.md`, the README.md, and the various prompts in lib.rs before planning so you can get a strong feel for what this project is about.
Please also take a careful look around the implementation to understand the architectural and styling patterns before implementating

See `docs/` for system documentation; `docs/prompt-config-matrix.md` is the canonical reference for prompt scopes, kinds, and config levers.
See `docs/config-reference.md` for the full configuration catalogue (agents/prompts/workflow/gates/display) plus override examples; `vizier plan` echoes the resolved settings.
Help output now routes through a TTY-aware pager (`--pager`/`--no-pager`, `$VIZIER_PAGER`) and honors `--no-ansi`/quiet; non-TTY always prints directly.

Please do not edit this file or the README unless you are a human being.
