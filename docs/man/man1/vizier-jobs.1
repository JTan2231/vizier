.SH NAME
vizier-jobs \- scheduler and job operations
.SH REFERENCE
.nf
Inspect detached Vizier background jobs

Usage: vizier jobs [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  list      List tracked background jobs (succeeded hidden by default; failures optional)
  schedule  Show scheduled jobs and dependency relationships
  show      Show details for a background job id
  status    Show a terse status line for a background job id
  retry     Rewind a failed/blocked job chain to its predecessor state and re-queue it
  approve   Approve a queued job that is waiting on explicit human approval
  reject    Reject a queued job that is waiting on explicit human approval
  tail      Tail logs for a background job (stdout/stderr); add --follow to stream until completion
  attach    Attach to both stdout and stderr for a running job
  cancel    Attempt to cancel a running background job
  gc        Garbage-collect completed jobs older than N days (default 7)

Options:
  -v, --verbose...                   Increase stderr verbosity (`-v` = info, `-vv` = debug); quiet wins over verbose, and output still honors TTY/--no-ansi gating
  -q, --quiet                        Silence progress/history; only errors and explicit output (help/outcome) remain
  -d, --debug                        Enable debug logging (alias for -vv; kept for parity with older workflows)
      --no-ansi                      Disable ANSI control sequences even on TTYs (non-TTY is always plain); useful for CI/log scrapers
  -l, --load-session <LOAD_SESSION>  Load session context from `.vizier/sessions/<id>/session.json` before running
  -n, --no-session                   Skip writing session logs (for compliance-sensitive runs)
      --agent <SELECTOR>             Agent selector to run for assistant-backed commands (e.g., `codex`, `gemini`, or a custom shim name). Overrides config for this run
  -C, --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>    Config file to load (supports JSON or TOML); bypasses the normal global+repo layering
  -P, --push                         Push the current branch to origin after mutating git history (approve/merge/save flows)
      --no-commit                    Leave changes staged/dirty instead of committing automatically (`[workflow] no_commit_default` sets the default posture)
      --follow                       Attach to a scheduled job and stream logs until completion (requires MESSAGE/--file when stdin would otherwise be read)
  -h, --help                         Print help
  -V, --version                      Print version
