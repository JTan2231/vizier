.SH REFERENCE

A CLI for LLM project management

Usage: vizier [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  help           Show a short, workflow-oriented help page (or the full reference with --all)
  ask            One-shot interaction that applies the default-action posture (snapshot/narrative updates plus any agent edits) and exits
  draft          Generate an implementation-plan draft branch from an operator spec in a disposable worktree
  list           List pending implementation-plan branches that are ahead of the target branch
  cd             Create or reuse a plan workspace and print its path
  clean          Remove Vizier-managed plan workspaces
  plan           Print the resolved configuration (global + repo + CLI overrides) and exit
  jobs           Inspect detached Vizier background jobs
  completions    Generate shell completion scripts
  approve        Implement and commit a stored plan on its draft branch using a disposable worktree
  review         Review a plan branch (runs gate/checks first), stream critique, and optionally apply fixes
  merge          Merge approved plan branches back into the target branch (squash-by-default, CI/CD gate-aware)
  init-snapshot  Bootstrap `.vizier/narrative/snapshot.md` and narrative docs from repo history
  test-display   Smoke-test the configured agent/display wiring without touching `.vizier`
  save           Commit tracked changes with an LLM-generated message and update snapshot/narrative docs

Options:
  -v, --verbose...
          Increase stderr verbosity (`-v` = info, `-vv` = debug); quiet wins over verbose, and output still honors TTY/--no-ansi gating

  -q, --quiet
          Silence progress/history; only errors and explicit output (help/outcome) remain

  -d, --debug
          Enable debug logging (alias for -vv; kept for parity with older workflows)

      --no-ansi
          Disable ANSI control sequences even on TTYs (non-TTY is always plain); useful for CI/log scrapers

      --pager
          Page help output when available; defaults to TTY-only paging and honors $VIZIER_PAGER

      --no-pager
          Disable paging for help output even on a TTY

  -l, --load-session <LOAD_SESSION>
          Load session context from `.vizier/sessions/<id>/session.json` before running

  -n, --no-session
          Skip writing session logs (for compliance-sensitive runs)

      --agent <SELECTOR>
          Agent selector to run for assistant-backed commands (e.g., `codex`, `gemini`, or a custom shim name). Overrides config for this run

      --agent-label <LABEL>
          Bundled agent shim label to run (for example, `codex` or `gemini`); overrides config until the end of this invocation

      --agent-command <PATH>
          Path to a custom agent script (stdout = assistant text; stderr = progress/errors); wins over labels/config for this run

  -j, --json
          Emit the audit/outcome as JSON to stdout (human epilogues may be suppressed depending on the command)

  -C, --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>
          Config file to load (supports JSON or TOML); bypasses the normal global+repo layering

  -P, --push
          Push the current branch to origin after mutating git history (approve/merge/save flows)

      --no-commit
          Leave changes staged/dirty instead of committing automatically (`[workflow] no_commit_default` sets the default posture)

      --background
          Deprecated: assistant-backed commands always enqueue jobs; use --follow to stream logs

      --follow
          Attach to a scheduled job and stream logs until completion (requires MESSAGE/--file when stdin would otherwise be read)

      --no-background
          Deprecated: foreground execution is no longer supported for assistant-backed commands

  -h, --help
          Print help

  -V, --version
          Print version
