.TH VIZIER-WORKFLOW 7 "UNRELEASED" "Vizier" "Miscellaneous Information Manual"
.SH NAME
vizier-workflow \- operator workflow patterns for init, list, jobs, and release
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vizier now exposes a reduced operational surface focused on repository bootstrap,
plan visibility, scheduler introspection, and release automation.
Internally, workflow-template metadata classifies agent execution as
\fBcap.agent.invoke\fR and prompt construction as explicit
\fBcap.env.*.prompt.resolve\fR nodes under a canonical-only \fBuses\fR contract
(\fBcap.env.*\fR, \fBcap.agent.invoke\fR, and \fBcontrol.*\fR only); this does
not add user-facing commands.
.SH COMMAND SET
.PP
Primary user-facing commands are:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBvizier init\fR / \fBvizier init --check\fR
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBvizier list\fR
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBvizier jobs ...\fR
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBvizier release\fR
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fBvizier completions\fR
.PP
\fBvizier cd\fR and \fBvizier clean\fR remain exposed but return deprecation
errors in scheduler-managed environments.
.SH JOB OPERATIONS
Use \fBvizier jobs\fR to inspect and control background job records:
.IP "\(bu" 2
List/schedule views for queued/running/blocked jobs.
.IP "\(bu" 2
Tail/attach for stdout/stderr streams (including \fBjobs tail --follow\fR).
.IP "\(bu" 2
Approval/reject/retry/cancel/gc controls.
.SH RELEASE FLOW
Use \fBvizier release --dry-run\fR to preview release versioning and notes,
then \fBvizier release --yes\fR to create release artifacts.
.SH WORKFLOW GUIDE
