.TH VIZIER-WORKFLOW 7 "UNRELEASED" "Vizier" "Miscellaneous Information Manual"
.SH NAME
vizier-workflow \- operator workflow patterns for draft, review, and merge
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vizier's default operator flow uses dedicated plan branches and auditable command
checkpoints. This page summarizes the user-level workflow contract.
.SH PLAN LIFECYCLE
.IP "1. Draft" 4
\fBvizier draft\fR creates \fIdraft/<slug>\fR and writes the implementation plan.
.IP "2. Approve" 4
\fBvizier approve\fR applies the plan on the draft branch in an isolated worktree.
.IP "3. Review" 4
\fBvizier review\fR runs checks/gates, streams critique, and can optionally apply
fixes on the draft branch.
.IP "4. Merge" 4
\fBvizier merge\fR integrates approved plan work into the target branch (squash by
default), enforces CI/CD gate policy, and cleans up plan artifacts.
.SH BUILD AND PATCH FLOWS
\fBvizier build\fR and \fBvizier patch\fR queue multi-step workflows through the
scheduler and template policy surface.
.PP
Use \fBvizier jobs\fR to inspect queued/running states, dependencies, approvals,
locks, and logs.
.SH RESUME AND CONFLICT HANDLING
When merges hit conflicts, Vizier writes resume state under
\fI.vizier/tmp/merge-conflicts/\fR and expects operators to rerun
\fBvizier merge <slug> --complete-conflict\fR after resolution.
.PP
Build execution resume state is persisted under
\fI.vizier/implementation-plans/builds/<id>/execution*.json\fR with policy-drift
diagnostics.
.SH GATES AND CHECKS
Workflow outcomes can be gated by repository policy:
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB[review.checks]\fR commands during \fBvizier review\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB[merge.cicd_gate]\fR script and retries during \fBvizier merge\fR.
.IP "\(bu" 2
\fB[approve.stop_condition]\fR loop checks during \fBvizier approve\fR.
