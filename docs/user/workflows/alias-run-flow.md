# Command Entry Points

This page summarizes command entry points that remain available after the workflow-command removal.

## Repository Setup

Run `vizier init` once per repository (or `vizier init --check` in CI) to ensure required marker files and `.gitignore` coverage exist.

## Pending Plan Visibility

Use `vizier list` to inspect pending `draft/*` branches and associated summaries.

## Job Operations

Use `vizier jobs` for scheduler/job records:

- `vizier jobs list`
- `vizier jobs schedule [--watch]`
- `vizier jobs show <job>`
- `vizier jobs tail <job> [--follow]`
- `vizier jobs attach <job>`
- `vizier jobs approve|reject|retry|cancel|gc ...`

## Release Flow

Use `vizier release --dry-run` to preview version/tag/notes and `vizier release --yes` to create artifacts.

## Shell Completions

Use `vizier completions <bash|zsh|fish|powershell|elvish>` to generate completion scripts.
