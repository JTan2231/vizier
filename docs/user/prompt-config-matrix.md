# Prompt Config Matrix

The workflow/agent command family has been removed from the CLI surface, so prompt-scoped command matrices are currently not active in user-facing command execution.

## Current State

- No top-level command consumes per-command prompt profiles at runtime.
- Prompt docs remain available as repository artifacts for future use, but they are not part of the active CLI contract.
